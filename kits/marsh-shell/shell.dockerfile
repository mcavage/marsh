# marsh shell Kit: the DHI Debian runtime base plus the Kit VM floor (Docker
# Engine, which runs this Kit's jobs from this same image), the POSIX text
# tools and python3 (also as `python`), assembled from Debian packages in a -dev build stage
# (image-base/assemble-packages.sh). The runtime image has no package manager.
